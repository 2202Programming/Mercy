## Background
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_common_subsequence_problem

Used commonly in bioinformatics to find common patterns in large sequences of DNA, there are several different variations on this algorithms, but they can all be built using the same basis.

## Complexity

This is a Dynamic Programming implementation of the Longest Common subsequence Problem.

It has a time Complexity of O(nm), and a space complexity of O(nm). Further optimizations could be used to improve the space efficiency to O(n + m)

  - n = Length of the first subsequence.
  - m = Length of the second subsequence.
