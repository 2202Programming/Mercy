# Mercy
Collection of Helper functions and other methods to assist in doing almost anything in any language.

This project in the end will be full of useful little helper functions each useable by themselves to solve a specific goal or functions. Some example topics that could be done in this project, would be empty array initializers, event loggers, string formatters, fileIO helpers, web API assessors, frequency generators, and whole bunch of other topics, their is no limit to what you can add to this repo as long as it solves a general problem, not one specific task.

This code files are designed to help people solve a problem, not solve a problem. Please don't use these files if you are learning to program, and it matches your assignment, that defeats the purpose of learning.
